History

It is a central place where you can store your files and documents. You don´t have to upload your personal data to central closed services like Google Docs, Dropbox or Ubuntu One. All the data is under your own control.
You can access your files via WebDAV from Linux, Mac and Windows Desktops without a special client 
On March 2016 they launched OwnCloud Server 9.0 is the biggest OwnCloud release so far with major enhancements like the introducion of innovative collaboration features, improvements to scalability and bringing federation to a new levelhttps://OwnCloud.org/blog/OwnCloud-server-9-0-released/
Description:
Music player and server for OwnCloud and Nextcloud. Shows audio files stored in your cloud categorized by artists and albums. Supports mp3, and depending on the browser, many other audio formats too. Supports shuffle play and playlists. The application includes an experimental Ampache server.
Normally, the Music app detects any new audio files in the filesystem on application start and scans metadata from those to its database tables when the user clicks the prompt. The Music app also detects file removals and modifications on the background and makes the required database changes automatically.
This app utilizes 2 backend players: Aurora.js and SoundManager2.
SoundManager2 utilizes the browser's built-in codecs. Aurora.js, on the other hand, uses Javascript and HTML5 Audio API to decode and play music and doesn't require codecs from browser.
The Music app uses SoundManager2 if the browser has a suitable codec available for the file in question and Aurora.js otherwise. In practice, Firefox and Chrome use SoundManager2 for all supported audio formats

Governance

OwnCloud started with a keynote by Frank Karlitschek at Camp KDE’10 where he talked about the need of a self-controlled free and open source cloud.
Two years later,(in 2010) Frank announced the start of OwnCloud Inc.
The company makes it possible for developers to work full time on OwnCloud, organizing OwnCloud events, marketing OwnCloud to a wider audience and supporting companies, governments and schools in their OwnCloud deployments.
The business model of OwnCloud Inc. is very similar to other successful Open Source companies, offering services and support around OwnCloud for the enterprise. The company is dedicated to working entirely in the open, accelerating development in the areas of its customers' needs while enabling a completely open development process where everybody can contribute.
The company is  looking for developers to make this happen. Especially PHP developers for the server and Qt developer for the syncing client are welcome.
The client could also be implemented in a scripting language like for example Python.
website and wiki: OwnCloud.org
mailinglist: OwnCloud@kde.org
git: http://gitorious.org/OwnCloud/

Open TODOs are:
– Remove the dependency on MySQL to make the installation of your OwnCloud easier. Perhaps SQLite
– Internationalization of all texts.
– Better Ajax Web Interface (Plasma Theming perhaps?)
– Better documentation. Especially for installation.

Issues

Case 1 #567

Status: failed

Description:

When the recipient of a shared audio file unshares it, the file reference is left in the music database of the recipient. To get rid of it, the database has to be regenerated. Fixing this requires a change into OwnCloud/Nextcloud core. #567
Albums with same name but different artists or years are now different albums"
3 albums with the same name just because the year is different.

Comments:

A solution for album with songs with different years might be to display the year range (e.g. 2004-2013)
It was a duplicated cases which was opened #279 ,#307
he has lots of issues in his uploaded building job #1480.1 Errored

Case 2 

Fix Music app not being localized #592

Status: Passed

Description:

The localization of the Music app has not worked for long time. The main reason for this was that l10n.pl script of the app created .php files containing the translations but the core expected to find .js and/or .json files. As there was no .js/.json files available under the directory l10n, the core interpreted that the Music app has no localizations and always selected English as active language.
There were also several other l10n-related issues, see commit messages for further details. After fixes made here, there still are some localization issues. But at least the localization can now be tested.
Fixes #246
Fixes #337

Comments

One of the commits which was added by the developer includes his comments
Clone localizations of some languages to another name to enable these languages also on Nextcloud
- Nextcloud uses different language codes for certain languages compared to OwnCloud. For example, Finnish is 'fi' instead of 'fi_FI' and Norwegian is 'nb' instead of 'nb_NO'.
- To show localized strings properly both on Nextcloud and OwnCloud, we need to copy the relevant translations so that they are available with both names
- A script duplicate-lang.py was created for the copying. It can be run by executing 'make l10n-clone' in the build directory. After this, 'make l10n-compile' has to be run to generate code from the translations files (the music.po files).
- Removed the en@pirate language. It was only a stub and Transifex does not seem to have any translation project for such "language".

Add one missing localizable string to fake-template  this issue was in #246
- The string under user settings has not got any translations because it was missing from the fake-template
